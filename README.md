# This repository consist of Notebook used to train the RNN-ROM model to predict the temperature and Salinity fields

## The RNN-ROM consist of two parts:
### 1.LSTM-Autoencoder- Notebook ILSTM_Spatial_Autoencoder-Salinity-AC.ipynb and ILSTM_Spatial_Autoencoder-Temperature-AC.ipynb has the code used to reduce the underlying dimension of the Salinity and Temperature respectively.
### 2. GRU+FC - Notebook ILSTM_Tempo_DNN-Salinity.ipynb and ILSTM_Tempo_DNN-Temperature-AC.ipynb has the code to evolve the latent space in time for Salinity and Temperature respectively.
